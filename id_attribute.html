        A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.<br> 
        There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.<br> 
        Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.<br> 
        Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.<br>

        In computer science and computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms.<br> 
        In some cases, the algorithm's basic operations are tightly coupled to the data structure's design. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and<br> --
